    Finding HTML Elements
    Often, with JavaScript, you want to manipulate HTML elements.

    To do so, you have to find the elements first. There are several ways to do this:

    Finding HTML elements by id
    Finding HTML elements by tag name
    Finding HTML elements by class name
    Finding HTML elements by CSS selectors
    Finding HTML elements by HTML object collections
